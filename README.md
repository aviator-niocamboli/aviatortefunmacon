## What is Aviator?

Aviator is an online casino game that has taken the gaming world by
storm. It combines the thrill of gambling with the excitement of an
arcade game. Players place bets on a plane that takes off and flies
higher and higher, multiplying their bet as it climbs with a multiplier.
The thrill lies in deciding when to cash out and secure your winnings
before the plane flies away, leaving you with nothing.
